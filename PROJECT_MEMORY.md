# R&L Cargo — Project memory index

Central memory for every Claude Code session on R&L Cargo. Entry point: [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md).
Memory is a guide, not proof: **re-verify against code, GitHub and production before acting**.

- Production: https://cargo.regaplatform.com (Cloudflare Worker `rega-cargo`)
- Staging: https://rega-cargo-staging.rebar9988.workers.dev (Worker `rega-cargo-staging`)
- Repo: `rebar9988-max/rega-cargo`, default branch `main`
- Last memory update: **2026-10-11 ~15:25 UTC**, against `main` @ `520905c` (+ memory PR #63)

## Current state (verified 2026-10-11 15:14–15:20 UTC)

| Area | State | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Public pages | `/`, `/stores`, `/quote`, `/ai`, `/robots.txt` return 200; `<html lang="ckb" dir="rtl">` | `curl` against production |
| R&L AI | On (`/api/ai/status` → `{"enabled":true}`) | production |
| Live Worker version | `7b92d650`, deployed 2026-10-11 15:11 UTC (source commit not recorded) | Cloudflare API |
| **Production database** | **BROKEN — blocker (I-1).** The Worker queries `misty-recipe-03041407/neondb`, which only has `0002_market.sql`. `/market` renders its error state; logs: `column p.compliance_status does not exist`, `relation "prohibited_keywords" does not exist` | 6 uncached `/market` probes: `misty/neondb` rollbacks 257→287, `old-cherry/cargo` stayed 0; `wrangler tail` (7/7 requests) |
| Correct database | `old-cherry-79292410`, database `cargo`: 12/12 migrations (09:38 UTC), 8 compliance triggers, 378 banned keywords | Neon read-only SQL |
| Customer data | **None in either database** (0 products, users, requests, orders) — repointing loses nothing | `pg_stat_user_tables` on both |
| Hyperdrive config `795013d0…` | Origin cannot be read by agents (API and `wrangler hyperdrive get`: `Authentication error 10000`) | Cloudflare |
| Sign-in | Worker logs `auth is disabled (VITE_AUTH_ENABLED=false)`; Better Auth fails closed and phone codes cannot be sent, so nobody can sign in (I-3, I-6) | `wrangler tail` |
| Banned-products protection | Holds via the bundled list in `src/lib/compliance/rules.ts` | `wrangler tail`: "using bundled list" |

## Next safe continuation point

1. **Owner action (blocker, I-1)** — agents lack the Hyperdrive permission and need owner approval for secrets/deploys. Exact steps in [issues.md](docs/project-memory/issues.md) (I-1 "Fix").
2. After the owner's change: run the verification recipe in [deployments.md](docs/project-memory/deployments.md) ("Which database does production use?") and the post-deploy checklist; record results here.
3. Open PRs — see [progress.md](docs/project-memory/progress.md).
