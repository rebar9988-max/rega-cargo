## Active / open PRs

| PR | Branch | Title | State |
|---|---|---|---|
| #77 | `claude/ci-minutes-recovery` | ci: spend fewer Actions minutes (docs-only skips layout, drafts wait, superseded PR runs cancel) | open 2026-10-12; workflow-only, no Worker change; local verify gate green (417 tests); hosted CI cannot start (I-7) |
| #51 | `claude/rl-cargo-safe-expansion-0rike6` | Product-link check + homepage/catalogue refinements | open; verified 2026-10-12: all its design commits are ancestors of `main` (via #60) and its product-link part is in `main` via #53, so nothing unique remains. Owner decides whether to close; not touched |
| #49 | `claude/rega-cargo-clone-oyhxb4` | Official R&L logo, soft 3D buttons, ten-group catalogue | draft; verified 2026-10-12: its commits are ancestors of `main`; logo files byte-identical. Nothing unique remains. Not touched |
| #48 | `brand/official-rl-logo` | Replace R&L branding with the official logo | open; verified: same 1254x1254 artwork as `public/rl-logo.png` on `main` (mean pixel diff 0.49/255); only changes the asset pipeline and conflicts across 22 commits. Not touched |
| #9 | `docs/rl-ai-architecture` | R&L AI architecture proposal | open (design only); outdated: says nothing is implemented, but `/ai` ships |

"Likely superseded" is an assumption — compare the diff against `main` before closing anything.

## Pending (owner or approval needed)
- **GitHub Actions starts no job** (since ~2026-10-11 15:38 UTC, also on `main`). Verified: account billing block (I-7; re-verified 2026-10-12 18:36 UTC). No PR can be merged or deployed without CI until the owner fixes it.
- Repoint production DB (issues I-1) — blocker for market, requests, tracking, accounts.
- Choose phone sign-in provider (I-3); Turnstile keys; enable auth (I-6).
- Approve held catalogue groups (`food`, `beauty/health`, `pets/food`).
- Native translation review; real legal details (I-5).
